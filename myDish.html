        <p>
            My favorite dish is Idli. Idli is a traditional South Indian dish known for its light, fluffy texture and mild flavor. The fermentation process not only enhances the idli's taste but also makes it easily digestible and rich in beneficial bacteria.

            Python Code Snippet
        </h3>
        <p>This command invokes the Python interpreter with the -m flag, which runs the venv module to create a virtual environment named projectnamevenv. This virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies from other projects and the system Python installation, allowing you to manage packages specific to your project without conflicts. You can name the environment whatever you like, but it's common to use the project name followed by venv for clarity.</p>
        <pre>python -m venv projectnamevenv</pre>
